# Java Online Shop – Advanced Programming Final Project

## Course: Advanced Java Programming  
This repository contains the final project for the **Advanced Programming with Java** course. The project is a **console-based Online Shop system**, implemented in two phases.

---

## Project Description  
The goal of this project was to simulate a **real-world online shopping system** using Java and object-oriented design principles. The application allows for interaction with users via a **console interface** in the IDE.

The project was developed in **two main phases**, and all requirements, use cases, and technical details are described in the PDF documents included in each phase’s folder.

---

## Project Structure  

- **Phase 1**:  
  - Basic system architecture  
  - Initial implementation of product listing, users, and basic functionality  
  - Introduction to class structure and object interactions  
  - [Phase1.pdf] – contains full documentation of requirements and implementation

- **Phase 2**:  
  - Full feature set: shopping cart, orders, seller's panel, and more  
  - Enhanced classes and new modules  
  - Application flow finalized  
  - [Phase2.pdf] – contains detailed explanation of new features and design choices

---

## User Interaction  
All user interactions happen **via the console window of the IDE** (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans).  
The application prompts for inputs and guides the user through the process of shopping, managing products, and viewing orders.

---

## Technologies Used

- Language: **Java SE**
- Paradigm: **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- IDE: Recommended – **IntelliJ IDEA** or **Eclipse**
- No external libraries or databases used (pure Java-based solution)

---

## Features Implemented (across both phases)

- User management (customers and admins)  
- Product catalog with add/edit/delete features  
- Shopping cart functionality  
- Order management  
- Basic authentication simulation  
- Object-oriented architecture with reusable classes and encapsulation

---

## How to Run the Project

1. Open the project folder in your preferred Java IDE  
2. Open the main class (e.g., `Main.java`)  
3. Run the program – the console will guide you step by step  
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the system

## Notes

- Some keywords and labels in the project use *Finglish* (Persian written with Latin alphabet). For example, instead of "login", the word "lagin" is used.
- Make sure to **read the PDF files** for full documentation, structure, and feature explanations  
- All inputs and outputs happen in the **console**, and the application does **not** use a graphical UI
- This project is intended for **educational purposes**, simulating core functionalities of an e-commerce platform
- **Important**: Before running the project, make sure to search for the keyword `"save"` using `Ctrl + F`,  
  and update the **file paths** according to your own system or preferred directory structure.

## Final Thoughts  
This project helped us apply Java OOP principles in a practical context. It serves as a great base for extending into GUI-based or database-connected applications in future.

*We hope this project is helpful for anyone learning Java or designing console-based applications!*
